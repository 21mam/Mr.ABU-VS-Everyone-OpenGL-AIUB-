## 📖 Project Description

**Mr. ABU VS Everyone** is a 2D side-scrolling action platformer built entirely from scratch using C++ and the OpenGL (GLUT) library.

The game features a custom physics engine (gravity, friction, collision detection), three distinct graphical themes, and challenging boss fights. It demonstrates the fundamentals of computer graphics, including primitive rendering, transformation, lighting, and state management, without relying on modern game engines.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Three Unique Levels:**
    * 🏙️ **Level 1 (The City):** An urban landscape with skyscrapers, industrial tanks, and gothic spires.
    * 🌲 **Level 2 (The Wild):** A nature-themed environment with realistic cloud rendering, stone walls, and dynamic trees.
    * 👽 **Level 3 (Mars):** An alien planet featuring red terrain, laser traps, space mines, and a starry sky background.
* **Custom Physics System:** Implements gravity, jumping mechanics, momentum, and friction.
* **Boss Battles:** Unique boss mechanics for every level, including a Katana-wielding Ninja and an Alien Mech.
* **Health & Life System:** Player health bars, knockback effects upon damage, and a lives counter.
* **Interactive Menu:** Mouse-driven main menu for level selection.

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A / D** | Move Left / Right |
| **SPACE** | Jump |
| **S** | Crouch / Slide |
| **W** | Attack (Sword/Laser Blade) |
| **Mouse** | Select Levels in Main Menu |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++ (Standard Libraries)
* **Graphics API:** OpenGL (Legacy Pipeline)
* **Window Manager:** GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
* **Development:** Visual Studio Code / Xcode

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
You need a C++ compiler (GCC/Clang) and the GLUT libraries installed.

### Compilation

**On macOS:**
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o game -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT -Wno-deprecated
./game
```
